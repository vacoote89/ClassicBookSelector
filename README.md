# Classic Book Selector
Create a project named ClassicBookSelector that contains a Form with a ListBox that lists at least five classic books that you think all educated people should have read. When the user places the mouse over the ListBox, display a Label that contains a general statement about the benefits of reading. The Label disappears when the userâ€™s mouse leaves the ListBox area. When the user clicks a book title in the ListBox, display another Label that contains a brief synopsis of the specific book. Also, change the BackColor of the Form to a different color for each book.
